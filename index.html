            <span class="indexParagraph">I am a dedicated and detail-oriented DevOps engineer with an Associate's
                degree, a certification from
                a comprehensive 6 month bootcamp, and hands-on experience gained through an internship at a Fortune 500
                Company
                for 6 months. During my internship, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to automate
                infrastructure,
                optimize deployment pipelines, and improve system scalability. <br><br>

                My technical expertise includes cloud platforms, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines,
                and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform). I am passionate about bridging the gap between
                development and operations, and I bring a practical approach to building and maintaining scalable,
                high-performance systems. <br><br>

                I thrive in environments where innovation and efficiency are key, and I am eager to contribute to teams
                that prioritize agile methodologies, continuous improvement, and collaboration.</span>

        <p class="bioTitle">Biography</p>
        <p class="indexParagraph2">Hello my name is Reynerio, but you can call me Rey! The first 10 years I struggle to
            decide
            what field I wanted to work at. I have an Associate degree as basic x-ray technician and I worked at the
            doctors office
            for a year. I really enjoyed the work I was doing and I thought helping people was something I wanted to do.
            There were
            several moments that were hard to handle. Seeing patients that have broken bones or a dislocation, it
            weighed heavy on me.
            After a year I decided to leave the doctors office due to the mental strain. <br><br>

            While I decided on what was my next career path, I worked in the hospitality field as a valet driver. I
            really enjoyed
            being a valet driver, it was my form of exercise for the week, I really enjoyed driving nice and expensive
            cars, and I
            was helping people in a different way. This is where I stayed for nearly 7 years. After the pandemic things
            were hard,
            things got more expensive and less people were going on vacation. I was losing income to take care of
            myself. I needed a
            new career. <br><br>

            This is when I came across YearUp United. I applied knowing I was nearly at their age limit, but I was
            hoping for a
            positive outcome. When they called me to inform me that I got accepted into their Application Development
            course I
            nearly cried. This was my new opportunity for a new life. During the YearUp Bootcamp I learned some of the
            basics of
            Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ect.) for 6 months. After six months, those who did well in the
            program
            were accepted into a internship through the corporate partners of YearUp. This is where we will spend 6 more
            months to
            hone our skills and become Application Development Professionals. I am hopeful for the results of this
            program and I
            intend to do my best at this internship.
